# Dynamic Programming
### This directory deals with my journey with Dynamic Programming.

### It won't be as easy as the other tracks, but I'll try to keep it simple.

### Much of the approaches to DP are directly inhereted following sources
### **www.geeksforgeeks.org**
### **Competitive Programming 3 (NSU)**

Starting from Set 0, every Set has the index prefixed with every code file, which is the way in which I recommend approaching the certain set.

## **Usually I will be starting by making a simple recursive solution to the problem, known as Top-Down approach.**
## **Then I'll add the power of memoization to the above approach in order to deal with overlapping sub-problems.**
## **Finally, I'll derive Bottom-Up approach from the latter to further decrease the complexity and run time.**
